# Exploring Quarto: Creating an Interactive Presentation

From articles to dashboards, there is a lot to explore when it comes to Quarto! R Markdown's extensive use and popularity has led to the development of Quarto, providing additional features and expanding to other languages such as Python. This repo contains an example of a **RevealJS presentation created in Quarto**, exploring some of its many features.

*This was presented at BristolR 2024 by Elizabeth Brown, Data Scientist at Branding Science Group.*

## Requirements

The presentation uses `{shiny}` and `{reticulate}`. To use python, create a virtual environment using `{reticulate}` and install the python packages `pandas` and `numpy`. For more details, see [Reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html)
